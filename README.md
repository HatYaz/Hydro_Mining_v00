Water Budget v00
How It Works : 
1- Users input values for precipitation, surface inflows, groundwater inflows, evaporation, outflows, TDS, and pH.
2- Click "Calculate Scenario" to compute:
2.1 - Water Balance (total inflows - total outflows).
2.2 - Water Quality (safe or contaminated based on TDS and pH).
The results are displayed inside the GUI window.
